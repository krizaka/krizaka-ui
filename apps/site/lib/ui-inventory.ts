/* The inventory of /docs/ui (krizaka-com#115): for every component of the catalogue, why it is there.

   - used     a product imports it today — lib/ui-usage.json, a dated scan of the committed sources of the product
              repositories (`npm run ui:usage`); the "why" is the product that uses it.
   - planned  nobody imports it yet, and a piece of planned work needs it: it is listed below with that work.
   - remove   no product uses it and no planned work needs it: it is deprecated (registry `status: deprecated`, with
              the major that removes it), never silently kept.
   A component that is neither used nor listed here fails tests/docs-ia.test.mjs: a new component arrives with its
   reason, or with a product that uses it. Words here are English, like the component pages they sit beside. */
